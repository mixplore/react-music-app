### Favourite functionality

Music records (albums or songs) from the Top 100 list can now be marked as 'Favourite'!

### How it works

Next to each record in the Top 100 list, a heart icon is displayed which indicates whether the record has been marked as 'Favourite' or not.
When a user clicks the heart shaped icon, the feed data in state gets updated and the icon changes to a filled heart shape meaning the item has been marked as 'Favourite'.
To keep the favourite status persistence, the data has been stored in local storage. 
Ideally, the app would've communicated with an API and the favourite status data would've been stored properly in a DB (considering the app would have an user account feature as well)
